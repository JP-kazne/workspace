Gerald has just learned about this program called Digital which allows him to create circuits. Gerald wants to send messages to his friend, also named Gerald, but doesn't want Gerald (a third one) to know what they are saying. Gerald, therefore, built this encryption circuit to prevent Gerald from reading his messages to Gerald.
