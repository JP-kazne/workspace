Clam was browsing armstrongctf.com when suddenly a popup appeared saying "GET YOUR FREE FLAGS HERE!!!" along with [a download](https://files.actf.co/6ddcb4e935b82c477140ee6833eceaf1149e0c732af1ba742a9e67db98693f88/free_flags). Can you fill out the survey for free flags?

Find it on the shell server at `/problems/2021/free_flags` or over netcat at `nc shell.actf.co 21703`.
