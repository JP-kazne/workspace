Attached is a packet capture taken from a building management network. One of the analog sensors reported values way outside of its normal operating range. Can you determine the object name of this analog sensor? Flag Format: flag{Name-of-sensor}. For example if the object name of this analog sensor was "Sensor_Temp1", the flag would be flag{Sensor_Temp1}. (Note: because there are a limited number of sensors, we're only giving you two guesses for this challenge, so please check your input carefully.)
