Try hacking my old version of apoche. Here are a list of running services. DM an admin if none of those work:

```
http://34.68.159.75:37173
http://34.68.159.75:41521
http://34.68.159.75:39733
http://34.68.159.75:55275
http://34.68.159.75:52555
```

Hint: There's something fishy about this apoche instance, if only there was a way to view the binary...
